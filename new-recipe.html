    <h1>The Best Chocolate Cake Recipe (Ever)</h1>
    <h2>Recipe by: Robyn Stone</h2>

    <p>It was great to hear that they thought the cake was just as good after their last bite as they thought it was with their first.

        Here’s another great thing about this recipe. The cake batter really can be made in a bowl without the use of a heavy duty mixer.<br>
        Of course, that just makes things easier, but this is easily a recipe my Grandmother would have enjoyed making in her tiny kitchen with a whisk and a bowl.<br>
        And I’m sure it would have turned out perfectly, too.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>&frac34; unsweetended cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1&frac12; teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.</li>
        <li>Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.</li>
        <li>Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.</li>
        <li>Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the pan and cool completely.</li>
        <li>Frost cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.</li>
    </ol>
