    <h1>Jordan Marsh's Blueberry Muffins</h1>
    <h2>By Marian Burros</h2>
    <p>This recipe came to The Times in a 1987 article by Marian Burros, "The Battle of the Blueberry Muffins."
        Two years prior, Ms. Burros wrote about a recipe for the muffins attributed to the Ritz-Carlton in Boston. The hotel had adapted a recipe used by Gilchrist's, once one of city's best-known department stores.
        After it ran, a reader wrote in to say that the best blueberry muffins in Boston were not from the Ritz-Carlton, but from the now-closed Jordan Marsh department store.
        She sent along the recipe, with a description of how she picks wild blueberries: standing in a pond in the August heat and plucking berries from bushes along the bank.
        This version has a lot more sugar and butter and fewer eggs than the Ritz-Carlton muffins.
        The recipe also calls for mashing a half cup of berries and adding them to the batter. This produces a very moist muffin, one that will stay fresh longer.</p>
