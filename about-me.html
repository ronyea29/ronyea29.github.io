            <h2>Take a minute to get to know me!</h2>

            <p class="bio">My name is Ronyea and I am 25 years old. I was born in California and moved here with my family when I was 5 years old.<br>
                As I've grown up, I have come to really enjoy art, nature and flowers, and eating. This goes perfectly with my hobbies, which are visiting art museums and galleries, hiking and spending time outside, as well as trying many new foods.<br>
                I have one dog, named Mia. She is two years old and very energetic. She loves to play tug-of-war and fetch with her toys. She also loves to go on walks and snuggle.
            </p>

            <p class="bio">I hope you enjoyed reading this short blurb about me.<br>
